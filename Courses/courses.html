      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="hr.pdf">Human Resourse</a></li></h3>
        <p>It is a truism to claim that people are an orgonisational resource-indeed for some organizations,
          they are the <strong>key</strong> resource, without which the orgnisation would be unable to deliver
          any meaningful product or service to its customers. Like any resource, however, people may be used
          wastefully: they may be employed at well below their potential, performing tasks which do not stretch
          their capabilities and which are ultimately alienating in their psychological impact on the employees
          involved. Alternatively, people may e managed and led in ways which inspire them to be highly motiveted
          and to demonstrate long-term commitment to both their roles and the organisation which employs them.
          When this is achieved, the performance of its people becomes a major differentiator for the organisation
          and a source of long-term competitive strength... <a id="hrc" href="hr.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="finance.pdf">Business Finance</a></li></h3>
        <p>Businesses are, in effect, investment agencies or intermediaries. This is to say that
          their role is to raise money from members of the public, and from other investors, and
          to invest it. Usually, money will be obtained from the owners of the business
          (the shareholders) and from long-term lenders, with some short-term ﬁnance being provided
          by banks (perhaps in the form of overdrafts), by other ﬁnancial institutions and by other
          businesses being prepared to supply goods or services on credit (trade payables
          (or trade creditors)). Businesses typically invest in <strong>real assets</strong> such as land, buildings,
          plant and inventories (or stock), though they may also invest in <strong>ﬁnancial assets</strong>, including
          making loans to, and buying shares in, other businesses... <a id="hrc" href="finance.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="marketing.pdf">Business Marketing</a></li></h3>
        <p>Marketing is so basic that it cannot be considered as separate function.It is
          the whole business seen from the point of view of its final result,that is, from
          the customer's point of view'. <strong>- Peter Drucker.</strong> Marketing is indeed
          an ancient art; it has been practiced in one form orthe other, since the days of
          Adam and Eve. Today, it has become the most vital function in the world of business.
          Marketing is the business function that identifies unfulfilled needs and wants, define
          and measures their magnitude, determines which target market the organization can
          best serve, decides on appropriate products, services and programmes to serve these markets,
          and calls upon everyone in the organization to think and serve the customer. Marketing is the
          force that harnesses a nation's industrial capacity to meet the society's material wants. It
          uplifts the standard of living of people in society... <a id="hrc" href="marketing.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="accounting.pdf">Business Accounting</a></li></h3>
        <p>Accounting is a system meant for measuring business activities, processing of information into reports
          and making the findings available to decision-makers. The documents, which communicate these findings
          about the performance of an organisation in monetary terms, are called financial statements.
          Usually, accounting is understood as the <strong>Language of Business</strong>. However, a business may have a lot of
          aspects which may not be of financial nature. As such, a better way to understand accounting could be
          to call it <strong>The Language of Financial Decisions</strong>. The better the understanding of the language, the better
          is the management of financial aspects of living.  Many aspects of our lives are based on accounting, personal
          financial planning, investments, income-tax, loans, etc. We have different roles to perform in life-the role
          of a student, of a family head, of a manager, of an investor, etc.... <a id="hrc" href="accounting.pdf">see more</a></p>

        <p>Law is essential to any society in that it provides the rules by which people and businesses interact.
          Law affects almost every function and area of business. The authors of one business law text go so far
          as to say that “the difference between winning and losing in the business world often depends upon the
          ability to make good choices from a legal perspective.”1 This is because almost every business decision
          has legal repercussions, including deciding whether to incorporate a business, obtaining financing,
          protecting proprietary knowledge used to develop products/services, entering into contracts to purchase
          raw materials, ensuring that products meet safety standards, disposing of plant wastes, promoting and
          pricing products/services, entering into contracts to sell products/services, and providing product
          warranties and aftersales service... <a id="hrc" href="business law.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="macroeconomics.pdf">Macroeconomics</a></li></h3>
        <p>We begin with some common terms and calculations from the realm of ﬁxed-income investments. The amount of the
          investment is called the principal. The “ﬁxed-income” from the investmentsiscalledinterest. The interest per
          unit of principal per unit of time is called  the interest rate. Most commonly, interest rates are quoted in
          dollars per year per dollar of principal. These units can be written: $=(y$). The dollar units cancel, so this
          interest rate has units of one over years. Similarly, if the interest rate is apples per day per apple borrowed,
          the apple units will cancel, and the units of the interest rate will be one over days. In general, the units of
          an interestrate areone over some unit of time. the unit of time is a year, we say that an interest rate is an annual
          interest rate. If the unit of time is not mentioned, then i twill almost always be anannual interest rate. Interest
          rates that are quoted in some speciﬁc unit of time can be converted to any other unit of time via a simple linear
          transformation... <a id="hrc" href="business law.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="entrepreneurship.pdf">Entrepreneurship</a></li></h3>
        <p>The word “Entrepreneurship” is derived from the French verb entreprendre which means “to undertake”. The term
          entrepreneurship thus refers to the following: <strong>•</strong>	The	process	of	identifying	opportunities	in
          the	market	place,	arranging	the	resources	required to pursue these opportunities and investing the resources
          to exploit the opportunities for long term gains. It involves creating wealth by bringing together resources
          in new ways to start and operate an enterprise. <strong>•</strong>	The	processes	through	which	individuals
          become	aware	of	business	ownership	then	develop ideas for, and initiate a business. <strong>•</strong>
          “The	art	of	identifying	viable	business	opportunities	and	mobilising	resources	to	convert	those
          opportunities into a successful enterprise through creativity, innovation, risktaking and progressive
          imagination” ...ILO Youth Entrepreneurship Manual, <br> 2009... <a id="hrc" href="entrepreneurship.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="customers service.pdf">Customers Service</a></li></h3>
        <p>There is only one boss, and whether a person shines shoes for a living or heads up the biggest corporation
          in the world, the boss remains the same. It is the customer! The customer is the person who pays everyone’s
          salary and who decides whether a business is going to succeed or fail. In fact, the customer can fire everybody
          in the company from the chairman (CEO) on down, and he can do it simply by spending his money somewhere else.
          Literally everything we do, every concept perceived, every technology developed and associate employed, is directed
          with this one objective clearly in mind – pleasing the customer. Sam M. Walton, CEO Wal-Mart Credo from Sam Walton

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="project management.pdf">Project Management</a></li></h3>
        <p>Anyone who has ever worked on a project will agree that making a project succeed is no simple task. The difficulties
          manifest themselves in (extreme) delays, (extreme) budget over-runs, inadequate results, dissatisfied customers,
          high stress among the project team and other undesirable outcomes. What is the cause of all of these problems?
          Projects are characterised by four features: a group of people, a goal, limited time and money and a certain level
          of uncertainty regarding whether the goals will be achieved. Project managers are involved with all of these aspects.
          Supervising and directing a project is thus anything but an easy task. Projects are becoming increasingly common.
          Project-based working methods have also found their way into non-profit organisations, including DANS.1 The rules
          of the game for projects in non-profit organisations differ from those in commercial organisations. Political factors
          play a particularly important role in non-profit organisations... <a id="hrc" href="international relation.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="international relation.pdf">International Relation</a></li></h3>
        <p>International relations, as it is presented in the flow of daily news, concerns a large number of disparate events:
          leaders are meeting, negotiations are concluded, wars are started, acts of terror committed, and so on. In order to
          make sense of all this information we need to know a lot about the contemporary world and its history; we need to
          understand how all the disparate events hang together. At university, we study these topics, but it is a basic tenet
          of the academic study of international politics that this rather messy picture can be radically simplified. Instead
          of focusing on the flow of daily news, we focus on the basic principles underlying it. This is what we will try to
          do in this chapter. So, let us begin by thinking big: what is international relations, how was it made, and how
          did it come to be that way?...<a id="hrc" href="international relation.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="social media marketing.pdf">Social Media Marketing</a></li></h3>
        <p>Business in today’s day and age is dominated by customers and their demands. People prefer to see referrals,
          reviews over Google search results, or a website before purchasing a product. To stand by the flow, we need to
          learn what people say about us. You need to actively participate in relevant communities to interact and
          influence masses. You need to engage with social media to manage your online reputation. Social media marketing
          is a must to target a wider customer base and expand your business. Social Media Marketing is the activity
          of driving website traffic through social media sites... <a id="hrc" href="social media marketing.pdf">see more</a></p>

      <h3><li><a id="hrc" href="business communication.pdf">Business Communcation</a></li></h3>
        <p>You may say that communication is important; you spend a lot of time doing it and you’re pretty good at communicating.
          After all, you talk to people, write notes, read books, and get along with other people which make you informed already.
          Why should you study communication?” The apparent simplicity of communication is deceptive. Just because we all communicate
          every day does not make us good communicators. Just because some aspects of effective communication are based on common sense;
          it does not mean common sense alone is enough. Skilled communicators draw on an extensive and complex body of knowledge,
          including semantics (the study of word choice according to their meaning), linguistics (the study of language), rhetoric
          (the study of writing and speaking effectively), psychology, sociology, graphic design, and even computer
          science.... <a id="hrc" href="business communication.pdf">see more</a></p>

        <p>As demands for deeper and more complex student learning have intensified, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers
          have begun to think more systematically about how to improve teachers’ learning from recruitment, preparation, and
          support, to mentoring and other leadership opportunities. Sophisticated forms of teaching are needed to develop 21st
          century student competencies, such as deep mastery of challenging content, critical thinking, complex problemsolving,
          effective communication and collaboration, and self-direction. In turn, opportunities are needed for teachers to learn
          and refine the pedagogies required to teach these skills...<a id="hrc" href="professional development.pdf">see more</a></p>
